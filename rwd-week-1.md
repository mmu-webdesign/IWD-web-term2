# RWD - Week One

## Developing content for your portfolio
We need you to start creating content for the 'responsive' portfolio web site you are about to develop over the coming weeks for assignment two.

[Heidi Cohen](https://twitter.com/heidicohen) describes content as:

>“High quality, useful information that conveys a story presented in a contextually relevant manner with the goal of soliciting an emotion or engagement. Delivered live or asynchronously, content can be expressed using a variety of formats including text, images, video, audio, and/or presentations.”

Well written content and high quality media is essential for the success of your portfolio.

### Theme

For simplicity we ask you to develop the content for your portfolio based on yourself and your job.

- **About me** – engaging text to attract and inform the user. Mindful of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), using relevant keywords and such. Tell the reader something about yourself. 150 words maximum. You may want to include links to your social media feeds in this section if you have them.

- **Work experience** – details of your current and previous work experience. Include relevant links and media. 200 words maximum. **NOTE** - If you have no work experience change this section to **Interests** in relation to your course.

However, in recent years some students have created successful pages by making a particular theme from work or home (a hobby) as the focus. If you would prefer to do this, please agree the topic with tutors before proceeding any further.  

## Original images for the gallery

It is important that your portfolio includes original media. Everyone has a camera in their pocket. Be creative, take some original photos to illustrate your theme and to engage the user.

- Take or create three original images to illustrate things important to you.
- Usually these are photographs (jpeg format). 
- If they are illustrations either gif, svg or png formats may be more relevant.
- If they can all be the same orientation (landscape or portrait) it does make things simpler, but is not essential. 
- The images can later be sized appropriately and optimized for the web when you know more about the layout you are creating.

>You will require a 4th original image for your 'big banner', often known as the 'hero' image. This is going to be used at a much larger size. It needs to be high quality. It should be landscape. 

- Your hero image will often set the scene for your portfolio. Its colours may also influence your colour scheme (although we may use filters to change this later). You are also going to be layering text (your heading) over the image.

- If you are struggling to create a high quality hero image (you really should try) - you can download and use [a free hero image from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hero-image). 

- Any images used MUST be copyright free and preferably available under the Creative Commons licence.

- Remember to keep the full size original images - always edit copies.

## Notes

**Try to have your text ready for Week Two and images for Week Three.**

As the project proceeds students often decide to *upgrade* (improve) their text and images before the final submission. You don't have to stick with the content created in initial weeks.
