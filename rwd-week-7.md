# RWD Week Eight

## Adding some JavaScript

### Adding the time-based message code

* The [initial state of the code is available on this codepen](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/43ef68f25d5275d02fa51d9e0298b419).
* There are two ways of adding the initial code:
1. *Inline*, which adds more code, in a different language, to an already busy page, which can confuse your text editor
2. Or as a separate JavaScript file, keeping the code separate in your editor, and making it easier to add updates and debug.

### Adding the code inline

* Go to the bottom of your HTML page (JavaScript **cannot** be added to CSS files)
* Just before the ending `<body>` tag, create a `<script></script>` tag
* Go to the codepen above
* Copy the code in the JS box
* Paste this code in between the `<script>` and `</script>` tag
* Refresh the HTML page: the code should now run.

### Adding the code as a separate file

* Go to the bottom of your HTML page (JavaScript cannot be added to CSS files)
* Just before the ending `<body>` tag, create a `<script src=""></script>` tag
* Create a folder to hold your JavaScript file (usually named `js`)
* Create a new file in your text editor
* Go to the codepen above
* Copy the code in the JS box
* Paste the JS code into your new file in your text editor
* Save the code with a sensible filename and a .js file extension, e.g. `time.js`
* Go to your HTML and in the `<script src=""></script>` add the path to your file
* In this example it would look like this: `<script src="js/time.js"></script>`
* Refresh the HTML page: the code should now run.

### Problems you may run into

* Old browsers might not run this code: if so, update your browser if possible
* Internet Explorer may not run the code if the HTML page is not online: Chrome and Firefox seem to be fine
* Don't add this code to the `<head>` of your page, as the DOM - defined in the lecture â€“ needs to be created before the code can work correctly
* Remember you have the console available in the web developer inspector in Chrome and Firefox to help if you are having problems - check the network tab and the console tab for errors.

### Things to do to customise the code for your site

* Change the message
* Change the hours
* Think about what might happen if the site visitor is not in the same country as you. Are they getting the right information if their computer is set to a different time-zone?
* Add more message options
* Anything else you think might be of use to a site visitor: just make sure that you are progressively enhancing the page, and that users without JavaScript won't be unduly penalised compared to users who do have JavaScript turned on.


## The JavaScript and instructions for the last week will be added shortly
