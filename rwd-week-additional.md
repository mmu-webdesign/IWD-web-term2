# RWD Additional

## Can I do more?

We have used a single page to introduce the concepts and techniques of mobile first, responsive web design.

Some of our more *technical* students ask what more can they do.

The usual response from many such students is to add technical complexity, usually via JavaScript. This is often not successful because these technical solutions are often implemented *for the sake of it*, and fail to enhance the user experience. In fact they often degrade the users experience and lose the student marks.

## Rule of thumb

Any further enhancements (elements beyond the brief):

1. User Experience - Must not damage the user experience, and hopefully improve it.
1. Accessibility - Must not impede accessibility and again, hopefully improve it.

We make the following suggestions for elements you might want to investigate and implement (through research and experimentation).

Complete the site as per the brief before attempting to create additional elements.

>Please back up your site - keep a copy of the *finished* site.

Do not remove elements created by the brief as you will be marked on these. It's obviously pointless adding something yet losing marks for the basics (because you deleted it).

## Additional HTML elements

Good, clean mark-up of your content is always going to get your marks. Using relevant HTML such as lists and tables (remember, tabular data only), blockquotes and such show your competence if used correctly.

[Semantics, semantics, semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML).

Additional CSS can be used to style these elements in an attractive, professional manner. See below.

## Enhanced media query

Once you have implemented the media queries as required, you could consider making further adjustments. An example might be that your main heading uses a different font size on larger screen sizes. It might be the same for your picture headings and captions. Margins might change. Always think about usability. *Am I enhancing the users experience*? In this example, am I make it more legible at these different screen sizes?

Don't go overboard - changing the colour scheme from mobile to desktop. Things like this are usually pointless.

## CSS Blends 

Investigate further use of blends to enhance your design. 


## CSS Transitions and animation

Investigate transitions and animation on MDN and CSS Tricks. Successful implementations are usually very subtle (not a rolling ball or animated text). Use with care.


## CSS Grid

Use of CSS Grid for part of the structure of your page is a great way to show off your advanced coding skills.

**Don't change the gallery to grid** as you will lose the marks for the flexbox. Think what other content you  could use grid to layout.

If you chose to go the whole way and restructure the site using grid, make sure you retain all the semantic structure we have provided. You should only be changing the CSS.

For everything about CSS Layout - see [Rachel Andrew's Grid by example](https://gridbyexample.com/).


## Responsive menu

The obvious solution is to replace Derren's menu with a *Hamburger* menu. Unfortunately this usually doesn't add to the UX (user experience). You now have to click twice, once to open the menu, once to select. Many of these menus need JavaScript (adds to weight of the page). They do however mean you gain screen space.

Think carefully though any solution - it needs to be as good, or an improvement (in our eyes), so check with tutors.

>If it is not your code, you must credit the source in a comment. **Don't** use code you don't understand.


## Form styling

Further form styling beyond what has already been implemented in the tutorial.


## Footer styling

Enhancing the footer styles - does it work well at all sizes? Addition of relevant professional company, social links or icons?


## Social

You can add links to your professional social media accounts. This is usually done via clickable icons. Use a [site like iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) to customise and download a png file, or to embed inline code for an svg.

If you use a png, optimise the file to the largest size used on your site.

SVG is an excellent option because it is purely code (no image file needed). This means it is lightweight and flexible - it can scale to any size.

Want to know more about SVG? Read the [MDN guide to Adding vector graphics to the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web).


## Styled tables
If you have used a table in your content (perhaps a list of job titles, employers and years?), you can then use CSS to style what will otherwise be a bring table.

Read: [MDN Styling Tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_boxes/Styling_tables) Subtle stripes using your tints plus use of borders can enhance the legibility. 

Check that your table works on mobile. Your table will be small so it shouldn't be a big issue. Large tables are a different matter - see the [Responsive Table roundup on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-table-roundup/) for some suggestions. 

## Video hero

A popular technique is to use a short, repeating, movie clip as the hero image. On a positive note, these can add to the user experience by helping to scene set or explain the page or product.

Like the large hero image they can add drastically to the weight of the page.

>[To add a Video Header follow this additional tutorial created by Derren](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/IWD-web-term2/blob/master/rwd-week-video.md). 

## Original illustrations

If you are an artist (or artistic) you might prefer to create some illustrations for the hero image and/or the gallery (instead of or as well as photographs).

Any illustrations created must still be exported and optimised for the web.

Make sure it is clear in your commentary that these are original works by yourself.

>If you are taking this route, please discuss with tutors in class. 

## Personal logo

Further to the above, branding your page with a personal logo is another option for the creative student.


## JavaScript

If you do think you can enhance the user experience of this simple page with additional JavaScript (beyond the required elements), please discuss with tutors before going ahead.

## Anything else?

Talk to tutors in class about any further ideas you may have for the additional development of your page.

Remember - just completing the assignment as directed to a high standard will gain you a very good, possibly excellent mark.
